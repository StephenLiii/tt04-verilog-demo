# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Twilight Cat Adventure"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Pixel cat running across twilight sky with stars and sunrise effect, with background music."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    The project draws a twilight sky background, stars blinking, a sunrise animation,
    and a pixel cat sprite running from right to left across the screen.
    Background music 'Ode to Joy' is played by PWM output.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    After reset, the cat sprite moves automatically from right to left.
    Background transitions from night to day while stars blink at night.
    The sun rises during background transition.
    Music plays through the PWM audio output.
